  "helpPanelContents.downloadParamFile": "The text area on this panel contains the installation parameter file that is needed for the installation. If you are familiar with the file format you can make manual changes. Note though, that changes made here are discarded when returning to a previous step.\n\nThe UI may also display additional information if any input data looks incorrect or is missing:\n- Steps with incomplete data: Review your input on the listed panels for completeness\n- Steps with invalid data: Review your input on the listed panels for correctness\n\nTo start the installation, copy the parameter file contents, or save it to a file and proceed with the steps outlined in the next panel.",
  "helpPanelContents.hint": "The installation assistant dialog asks for information relating to the target system and installation parameters of the Linux distribution to be installed. This information is typically provided by hardware or network administrators of the system to be installed. Be sure to obtain this data before continuing.",
  "helpPanelContents.information": "Review the minimum system requirements for the selected Linux distribution before continuing with the installation.\n\nIf the target system does not meet all of these requirements, the installation may fail.",
  "helpPanelContents.inputFileSelection": "Select the Linux distribution type and version that you want to install. This choice will affect the format of the resulting installer parameter file.\n\nNote that installer parameter file formats differ between distribution types, and may change with newer versions of the same type. In case the exact version is not available for selection, choose the same distribution type and closest version that is lower than the one to be installed.",
  "helpPanelContents.installationParameters": "During the installation process, the Linux installer requires additional files from the installation medium. These files must be provided via a network protocol by a server that contains an exact copy of the installation media contents.\n\nSpecify the URL to access installation files via the \"Installation address\" input field. Supported protocols are FTP, HTTP, and HTTPS. Use the \"Username\" and \"Password\" fields to specify access information if required.\n\nNote: Passwords will be encoded unencrypted in the resulting parameter file.\n\nOnce the installation is started, the installer can be controlled either via a VNC-based GUI, or an SSH text-based interface.\n\nSelect the VNC toggle and specify an optional password to enable the graphical installation.\n\nSelect the SSH toggle to enable text-based installation. Note that not all installer options may be available using the text-based interface.",
  "helpPanelContents.networkAddress": "Enter network address information for the target host in this panel. First select the IP version â€“ either IPv4 or IPv6. Depending on the IP version, IP addresses have a different format:\n- IPv4 addresses consist of 4 decimal numbers separated by dots, for example \"192.168.0.1\"\n- IPv6 addresses consist of up to 8 hexadecimal numbers separated by colons, for example \"fd00::1a\"\n\nNext, enter the IP address information:\n- Host IP address and prefix or netmask: the IP address assigned to the target host\n- Gateway IP address: the address of an IP gateway that the host can use to reach other networks\n- Nameserver IP address: the address of a DNS server to use for resolving host names into IP addresses\n- Host name: an optional name to be associated with the host\n",
  "helpPanelContents.networkDevice": "Specify the network device to use for accessing the installation media and to access the interactive installer.\n\nFirst select the type of network device that is available in the target system. Depending on the type, the dialog will ask for different parameters.\n\nTypes:\n1. Open Systems Adapter (OSA)\n2. PCI RDMA over Converged Ethernet (RoCE)\n\nFor OSA connections, specify the device bus-IDs that correspond to the read, write, and data subchannels. The device bus-IDs are of the format 0.x.y, where x is the subchannel set ID, and y is the device number.\n\nAdditional OSA parameters:\n- OSI Layer: Select Layer 2 if the network device is operating in Ethernet mode, or Layer 3 if it is operating in IP mode.\n- Port number: For adapters with multiple ports per CHPID, select port 0 or 1.\n\nFor RoCE, you can specify the network device either by the PCI function ID (FID), or the User-defined identifier (UID). Specify the UID if the target system has the partition UID uniqueness setting enabled, otherwise specify the FID. Both IDs are hexadecimal numbers.\n\nIf the network is configured as a virtual LAN, use the toggle button to enable the VLAN setting, and enter the VLAN ID.",
  "helpPanelContents.nextSteps": "To start the installation, follow the steps listed on this panel.",
  "helpPanelContents.summary": "To download the generated parameter file, aktivate the corresponding toggle. You can download the generated parameter file at any time from the landing page where you initially started the parameter file creation workflow.",
  "helpPanelContents.intro": "To use existing settings from a previous session as a baseline, aktivate the corresponding toggle. You can use such a baseline to tailor it according to your needs to compose a parameter file based on such an existing baseline.\n\nIf you set the toggle to not use the existing setting as a baseline, they will be purged and you will start composing a new parameter file from scratch.",
  "helpPanelContents.landingPage": "Review the available system requirement information prior to creating parameter files. A parameter file that has been created in a previous session can either be modified or discarded in supported to create a separate parameter file from scratch.\n\nParameter files from a previous session if any can be downloaded using the appropriate button on the \"Start composing\" card."
