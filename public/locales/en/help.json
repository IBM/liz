Depending on the type, the dialog will ask for different parameters.\n\nTypes:\n1. Open Systems Adapter (OSA)\n2. PCI RDMA over Converged Ethernet (RoCE)\n\nFor OSA, specify the network device by listing the associated three device numbers. The number format is 0.x.y where \"x\" is the device subchannel ID and \"y\" is the device number, both in hexadecimal format. Note that device numbers are typically sequential.\n\nAdditional OSA parameters:\n- Layer 2: Select 1 if the network device is operating in ethernet mode, 0 if in IP mode.\n- Port number: Specify the port number to use for devices that support multiple network ports.\n\nFor RoCE, specify the network device by either of two device IDs, the PCI function ID (FID) or the User-defined identifier (UID). Both IDs are hexadecimal numbers. Specify the UID if the target system has the partition UID uniqueness setting enabled, otherwise specify the FID.\n\nIf the network is configured as a Virtual LAN, enable the VLAN toggle and enter the matching VLAN-ID.",
