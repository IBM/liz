Background
==========

Currently the UI focuses on walking the user through the
workflow of creating a param file. Although the intend of
the application is not clearly communicated to the user.

For instance it is not clear what value the app would
provide and in which kind of broader context it is embedded.

As a result the product title suggests that the app is
about installing Linux on IBM Z where the app itself is
just providing a guided tour to create the param file.

We discussed the following
==========================

1.

We would provide a home screen where the user would be able
to start the param file creation app.

The home screen could have the layout of a dashboard using
tiles or similar UI components. The actual way of how the
home screen is provided still needs to be researched.

2.

We discussed that the actual param file generation app
would be provided as a so called tearsheet. The tearsheet
would contain a multi step workflow to guide the user
through the param file generation process.

The tearsheet would be stacked atop of the home screen.
Once closed the user would return to the home screen.

3.

The tearsheet component is part of the Carbon for IBM Products
open source project available on GitHub.
