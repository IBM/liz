Background
==========

On the UI as proposed we have user input fields that allow the user
to provide data using a long or short format. The discussion was 
whether to recalculate or expand the short format while the user
is typing so that the user would eventually end up with the long
format similar to what auto complete or spell checking does while
typing.

We discussed that expanding, completing or recalculating user
provided data inline as the user is typing or right after the user
did finish typing may confuse the user cause such data gets
instantly altered. Something the user may not want and also may
not understand cause the logic used to alter data is not known
by the user.

We discussed the following
==========================

1.

On the network device panel we won't alter the data the user did
provide. In other words we won't expand data that represnents a
short ID so that the user would end up with the long ID while
typing or right after having provided such a short ID.

2.

On the step for the param file generation where the param file
is provided, the short ID or any other data that needs to be
expanded, completed or recalculated, would be presented as expanded,
completed or recalculated data. In other words the short ID would
be tronsformed into a long ID and the param file generation step
would only use the long ID and never the short ID.

3.

On the network address step where the prefix is used to calculate
the netmask and vice versa, the above considerations won't apply
cause the data is not expanded, completed or recalculated inline
but using a second input field where the user is not typing.
