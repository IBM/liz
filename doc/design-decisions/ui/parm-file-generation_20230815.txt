Behaviour for invalid data
==========================

We discussed the following:

1. It must be possible that the user provides invalid data.
2. In cases where invalid data is provided the following behaviour will be exposed by the UI:
2.1 The form field that contains invalid data turns red and has an error indicator.
2.2 In the left hand navigation bar the step with the form field also has an error indicator.
3. On the param file generation step the following behaviour must be provided:
3.1 An error banner will be shown atop of the page calling out that there are steps with invalid data and thus this may result in an invalid param file format.
3.2 Despite the error banner the param file gets generated and also can be copied and/or downloaded.
