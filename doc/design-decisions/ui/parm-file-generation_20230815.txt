Behaviour for invalid data
==========================

We discussed the following:

A. Since users are allowed to access steps and provide data in a way that doesn't have a linear but rather ramdom flow, data to generate the param file may either be incomplete or invalid.
B. We could add a restriction that would enforce a linear workflow and also would prohibit navigating to the next step until data has been completely provided and is valid.
C. If doing so that adds a lot of pre-checking logic that must be maintained and it may render the user experience as something that feels to rigid.
D. Thus we agreed on the following.

1. It must be possible that the user provides invalid data.
2. In cases where invalid data is provided the following behaviour will be exposed by the UI:
2.1 The form field that contains invalid data turns red and has an error indicator.
2.2 In the left hand navigation bar the step with the form field also has an error indicator.
2.3 The header of a step if colapsed also has an error indicator.
3. On the param file generation step the following behaviour must be provided:
3.1 An error banner will be shown atop of the page calling out that there are steps with invalid data and thus this may result in an invalid param file format.
3.2 Despite the error banner the param file gets generated and also can be copied and/or downloaded.
