When and how to disable navbar items?
=====================================

We discussed the following:

1. Some steps as presented by the left navbar are containing information but no data must be provided.
2. These panels should be in an incomplete state if the UI is initially rendered.
3. Once a panel that contains such a step where only information is provided, the step indicator in the navigation bar must show a check mark.
