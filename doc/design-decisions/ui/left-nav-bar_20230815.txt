When and how to disable navbar items?
=====================================

We discussed the following:

1. Some steps as presented by the left navbar are mandatory steps.
2. These steps requirte the user to provite data and the date must be correct.
3. If either the data is missing or the data format is invalid certain actions must be taken.
4. We identified step one where the distribution is selected as the only mandatory step.
5. If a mandatory step contains no or invalid data the following actions must be taken.
5.1 In the left navbar every subsequent step must be inactive. In other words allowing the user to navigate to any subsequent step must be prohibited.
5.2 The "Continue with next step" button as it is part of a step equally must be inactive.
6. Aside of that we decided that any other step except the first step must not be treated as a mandatory step.
