_How to format code if contributing to liz_

== Overview

For liz the preferred language is JavaScript. We additionally consider migrating
the code base of the liz repo to TypeScript.

The coding style is based on the https://prettier.io/[Prettier Opinionated Code Formatter].

== Automatic Code Formatting

As mentioned earlier code formatting is governed using Prettier. It will analyze
code contributions during each commit and adjust the code style accordingly as
specified in the link:.prettierrc.json[.prettierrc.json] configuration file.
